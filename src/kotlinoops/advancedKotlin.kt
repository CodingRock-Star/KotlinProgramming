//Optionally, async can be made lazy by setting its start parameter to CoroutineStart.LAZY.

fun log(msg:String){

//We use a normal sequential invocation, because the code in the coroutine, just like in the regular code, is sequential by default.
// The following example demonstrates it by measuring the total time it takes to execute both suspending functions:

fun demoOfSync() = runBlocking(){
    val job =launch {
        val time = measureTimeMillis {
            val r1 = doWorkOne()
            val r2 = doWorkTwo()

    return 1
}
//Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines.
// The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later.
// You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.
fun demoOfAsync()= runBlocking {
    val job =launch {
        val time = measureTimeMillis {
            val r1= async {

            }
            val r2=async {
                doWorkTwo()
            }
          println("The result of two aync tasks ${r1.await()+r2.await()}")
        }
